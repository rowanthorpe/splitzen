TODO:
=====

In splitzen.cmd

* Fix strange bug which stops interactive file-naming in "join"
* Sanity checks for config
* Allow to specify in which directory to save created file(s)
* Add --join flag to force joining regardless of prefix heuristic
* Allow joining without setting the prefix correctly, by allowing drag-n-drop of checksum-file, and reading prefixes from the checksum-file

In head.cmd and tail.cmd

* Check deleting trailing blank lines problem (Fix=insert character,trim on output?)
* Remove need for temp file when using "-n +x"

General:

* Use batchscripting for as much as possible, remove as many Unixish-tool dependencies as possible
    - I managed to write an Adler32 and Fletcher32 checksum in batchscript, but both were prohibitively slow... (any better suggestions?)
* Remember never to go through the painful, disordered, futile hell of writing a Windoze batch-script again. Stick to Bash and Perl scripts, fool...
